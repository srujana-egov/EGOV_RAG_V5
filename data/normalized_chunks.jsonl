With building blocks, any solution can evolve to fit changing needs rather than building a new system from the ground up. DIGIT HCM is built using modular building blocks that are highly configurable, allowing countries to easily tailor the product to their specific needs. These blocks are reusable, enabling the creation of new solutions and facilitating reusable assets for all campaigns. Benefits of building blocks include: Easy to adapt to local needs (highly configurable and easy to rework). One asset usable for all campaigns (multiple campaign types and diseases). Maximised leverage (additive blocks that can create new solutions). With these building blocks, one campaign can be pivoted to set up another health campaign with minimal effort and time. For example, a malaria campaign can be pivoted from a cholera campaign or an NTD campaign. Beyond campaigns, the same blocks can create solutions for routine health delivery and other health needs. DIGIT HCM is designed around four core principles that address common challenges in health campaigns: Reusable Building Blocks What it does: Provides digital assets that can be easily reworked for different campaigns. What it solves: Eliminates the problem where solutions for one type of campaign cannot be reused in another case. Shared Data Registries What it does: Acts as a single source to create and use data across campaigns, avoiding repeat enumeration. What it solves: Breaks down data silos where data from different campaigns do not communicate with each other. Interoperability What it does: Integrates with multiple systems such as DHIS2, enabling coordination at scale. What it solves: Resolves poor coordination across campaigns and diseases. Free and Open Source Software What it does: Allows countries to own and evolve the digital assets as public infrastructure. What it solves: Addresses the lack of system ownership by country teams, removing barriers to innovation and reducing high costs. Data resides in shared open registries, enabling reuse of data and establishing a single source of truth. Interoperability is built into DIGIT HCM’s design, allowing free flow of data across systems. This enables countries to set up their digital public infrastructure for health. The use of shared registries helps avoid duplication and improves the quality of health campaign data. Current Siloed Approach: Each campaign creates discrete, separate datasets.

This enables countries to set up their digital public infrastructure for health. The use of shared registries helps avoid duplication and improves the quality of health campaign data. Current Siloed Approach: Each campaign creates discrete, separate datasets. For example, Malaria ’21, Polio ’21, and NTD ’21 maintain independent data stores. The same duplication happens in subsequent years such as Malaria ’22, Polio ’22, and NTD ’22. This leads to fragmented data where information does not flow across campaigns or years. Shared Registries Approach: Establishes a reusable, single source of truth for all campaigns. A centralized shared data registry holds core information. Campaign-specific updates (e.g., Malaria update, NTD update, Polio update) feed into this shared registry. Open APIs allow external systems to access and update data. Ensures consistency, reduces redundancy, and improves coordination across campaigns and time periods. From campaign setup and planning, inventory management, registrations, and service delivery to real-time dashboards, DIGIT HCM covers all elements needed to run effective campaigns.

Steps: Boundary Selection There are three scenarios: the user is assigned to work only at a community living facility, the user is assigned to work at both a community living facility and house to house, or the user is assigned to work house to house only. Home Screen Separate navigation is provided for community living facilities, transit posts, and household-based delivery. Clicking on each card navigates to the respective flow. Community living and transit post options are available depending on campaign requirements. The progress bar shows beneficiaries covered in household and community living facilities. Transit post coverage is tracked separately. Search CLF Screen Clicking the community living facilities icon opens the search page. The screen has a toggle to search nearby facilities, a search bar to find CLFs from the microplan, and filters. Facilities may include boarding schools, military camps, orphanages, retirement homes, university campuses, prisons, police camps, and refugee camps. Search Results When a CLF is found, a card is shown with the facility name and proximity. An action button opens the CLF. If no match is found, an information message is displayed.

Summary Screen A summary screen is displayed after recording facility interventions. Deliver Intervention with Preloaded Data If data is preloaded from the microplan, the delivery process automatically uses the down-synced facility data. Deliver Intervention without Preloaded Data If data is not preloaded, delivery depends on registration and follows the standard delivery screens. Transit Post KPI indicators show deliveries completed for the current date and cumulative. Captured details include type of transit post and name of transit post. Scan Resource Resources can be scanned using the scanner feature. If codes are not available for an intervention, the system moves directly to the delivery screen. Manual Entry If scanning fails, the resource code can be entered manually. Deliver Intervention at Transit Post The screen shows the number of deliveries, transit post details, resources to be delivered, eligibility conditions, and scanned resource details. Recording delivery increases the delivery count for a beneficiary. The process repeats until deliveries are completed. Closing the delivery ends the session.

In fixed post mode, campaigns have relied on household enumeration and later distribution at fixed posts. For individual-based campaigns, beneficiaries are usually part of households with up to 30 members. During the Nigeria Polio campaign, there was a need to administer vaccines at fixed locations like schools or community centers, as well as transit posts along roadsides or public places. Similar requirements exist for other campaigns such as Schistosomiasis in Nigeria, where medicines are delivered to children in residential schools. Other examples include nursing homes, orphanages, military or police camps, retirement homes, religious facilities, refugee camps, jails, schools, bus stands, and railway stations. Value Proposition As a campaign manager, I can configure delivery at fixed posts or transit points in HCM to ensure efficient interventions across diverse facilities. As a field worker, I can administer medicines on the go using HCM so that beneficiaries in non-household environments can be reached effectively. Goals and Objectives Enable HCM to cater to all delivery modes including polio campaigns and increase coverage by serving non-household entities. Key metrics include the number of non-household implementations, percentage of coverage through such campaigns, and number of polio campaigns. Key Terminologies Fixed Post: A known location from the microplan where interventions are delivered, e.g. bednet collection points. Community Living Facilities: Permanent structures like jails, schools, or camps with resident populations. House to House: Door-to-door delivery of interventions. Transit Post: Places like bus stops or stations where beneficiaries are not enumerated in advance. Only aggregate counts are captured. Assumptions Delivery logic varies by facility type. Modes of delivery may change day to day. The scope is based on field visits and validation with NMEP Burundi, Nigeria Polio, Kano field visits, and Malaria Consortium. Data is down-synced for assigned clusters or divisions. Prioritisation Features include searching CLFs, filtering results, mapping fixed post and door-to-door, removing duplicates, supporting transit posts, applying delivery logic by type, compliance for transit posts, and separate coverage cards. Out of Scope Adding new CLFs in the field. New facilities must be added in the backend and down-synced. User Personas Community Drug Distributors conduct enumeration and deliver interventions across households, CLFs, and transit posts. They can add beneficiaries, administer drugs, record adverse events, and make referrals.

In the Scope of this version of the Payments module: Editing Attendance Records Post-Event Completion Authorised personnel, such as proximity supervisors, can modify attendance records after an event concludes to correct errors or omissions made during initial data entry. Edits include correcting the number of days worked, or marking attendance for previously unrecorded participants. All edits are tracked and documented within the system for audit purposes. Approval of Attendance Records and Muster Roll Generation Once attendance records are reviewed and finalised, they are submitted for approval by proximity supervisors. Approved records are used to automatically generate the muster roll, which contains attendance details for the event. The muster roll becomes the official document for wage validation and payment processing. Reviewing Approved Registers Payment approvers or other authorised stakeholders can access and review attendance registers that have already been approved. The review process ensures compliance with organisational guidelines and verifies that data matches muster roll records before payment reports are generated. Viewing Approved and Unapproved Registers Users with appropriate permissions can view both approved and pending approval attendance registers. This view allows campaign managers to monitor the status of attendance records for all events within a given boundary. Filters and search functionalities may be available to help locate specific registers based on event type, date, or boundary. 2. Out of Scope and features not included in this version of the Payments module are as follows: Campaign Worker Onboarding: Workers must be onboarded via the HRMS or Console web interfaces, as this is not supported in the app. Worker Registry Validation: The module does not support checks for: - Duplicate entries or boundary over-allocations. - Mobile number authentication (inactive numbers or mismatches). - Identity verification or validation of mobile money accounts for status and transaction limits. Approval Workflows: Missing workflows for: - Payment report approvals - Muster roll approvals Attendance Corrections: No provision for: - Proximity supervisors returning attendance reports to field supervisors for corrections. - Payment approvers returning attendance reports to proximity supervisors for corrections or rejections. Worker Payment Configuration: Setting different rates for workers with the same role based on location boundaries is not considered for this version. Reporting Limitations: Support for generating intermediate reports before event completion is not considered for this version.

This role may be filled by a field team supervisor or any individual presiding over the event. Proximity Supervisor: Charged with approving the attendance recorded by the attendance marker. They verify attendance details (often via phone outside HCM) if discrepancies arise and have the authority to edit records after the event concludes. This role typically operates at the district level or higher. Payment Approver: Oversees the consolidation of attendance records to generate boundary-specific reports. They are responsible for approving the payment report, forwarding it to higher operations for additional approvals, and liaising with financial institutions to process payments. Dos and Don’ts for Key Roles in HCM Payments module: 1. Attendance Marker Do's: Mark daily attendance for all assigned registers without fail. Sync all records to ensure no pending entries remain on the device before the proximity supervisor edits or approves the attendance records for that event. Raise complaints for issues like adding/removing persons or correcting details of the staff using the complaints module or by contacting the system administrator. Don’ts: Submit incorrect attendance—once submitted, corrections are not possible for the attendance marker. 2. Proximity Supervisor Do's: Verify with the attendance marker for all the districts that all records are synced before editing or approving attendance. Make edits as necessary but ensure all details are accurate before final approval. Approve all registers systematically, completing one district before moving to the next. Raise complaints for issues like entry corrections via the complaints module or the system administrator. Don’ts: Approve attendance without confirming that all records are synced. Assume changes can be made after approval—final approvals are irreversible. 3. Payment Approver Do's: Double-check all details in the payment report (PDF/Excel) before submission to financial institutions. Generate payment reports for each boundary systematically, starting with one district and moving to the next, including provincial/national events. Wait 2-3 minutes for report generation before reporting issues. Don’ts: Editing Excel reports after generation is not allowed. Submit incomplete or inaccurate reports. 4. System Administrator Do's: Validate worker information (enumerators, supervisors, etc.) before onboarding them in the system, ensuring correct mobile numbers and IDs. Confirm no duplicate personnel or mobile numbers exist in the system. Map workers accurately per the microplan, avoiding over or under-allocations. Verify that mobile and bank account numbers belong to the correct person", "url": "https://docs.digit.org/health/access/public-health-product-suite/health-campaign-management-hcm/health-payments/payments-user-manual/guide-to-hcm-payments"}

How can I select a different type of attendance register? A. The first step as a proximity supervisor is to select the type of attendance register from the drop-down after logging in to the payments module. There will be multiple types of registers such as Master Training register, Registration team training, Campaign, etc. 9. As a proximity supervisor, I have selected one of the districts as a boundary. Which attendance registers can I manage? A. You can manage only those registers assigned at the selected district or boundary levels below the district. 10. As a payments supervisor, I have selected the country name. Which muster rolls can I generate the payment report for? A. You can generate the payment report for all the muster rolls that are assigned at a county level. 11. As a payments supervisor, I have selected a province name. Which muster rolls can I generate the payment report for? A. You can generate the payment report for all the muster rolls that are assigned at a province level. 12. As a payments supervisor, I have selected a district name. Which muster rolls can I generate the payment report for? A. You can generate the payment report for all the muster rolls that are assigned at a district level or below the district level. 13. What is a muster roll in the HCM payments module? A. A muster roll is a simple document used to keep track of workers and their activities. It records who showed up for work, the hours they worked, and sometimes their pay. It helps employers know who was present and how much work was done. In campaigns, a muster roll can track attendance and ensure workers are paid correctly for their efforts. 14. What is an event? A. In the context of attendance for a campaign, an event refers to a specific activity or session where workers or participants are expected to be present. This could include training sessions, daily fieldwork (registration/distribution), or any other scheduled task as part of the campaign. 15. When should I approve an attendance register? A. You must wait for the event to be completed to review and approve the attendance register.", "url": "https://docs.digit.org/health/access/public-health-product-suite/health-campaign-management-hcm/health-payments/payments-user-manual/guide-to-hcm-payments"}

Is it advisable to approve a register before an event is completed? What happens if I edit attendance during an ongoing event? A. Always approve the attendance register only after the event has fully concluded to ensure data accuracy. Editing attendance during an ongoing event will overwrite the current records, and the system will consider the edited data as final. Additionally, if the attendance register has been edited and approved, attendance markers attempting to record attendance will encounter errors, as there is no downward data flow from the proximity supervisor to the attendance marker 17. Which formats can I download the payment report in? A. The reports are available for download in Excel and PDF formats. 18. How can I view and download the bills I generated? A. Navigation: Login > Home Page > My Bills > Actions (Download in Excel/PDF) 19. Can I create bills again for already generated muster rolls? A. No, you cannot regenerate bills. However, you can view the generated bills as well as download them as many times as needed. 20. How long will it take to generate a bill? A. The bill generation can take up to 2-3 minutes depending on the number of registers collated. 21.How can I aggregate muster rolls into a single bill? Is aggregation mandatory? At what levels can aggregation occur? A. Aggregation of muster rolls can be done at different boundary levels, as described below: District Level: Muster rolls from all events created at the district or subordinate levels are aggregated for the selected event type. Example: Aggregating muster rolls for all registration events in the district of Nampula, including those at locality levels within Nampula. Province/State Level: Muster rolls from events across the entire province/state are combined. Example: Aggregating all muster rolls for distribution events across the province of Cabo Delgado. National Level: Muster rolls from events nationwide are collated. Example: Aggregating muster rolls for all master trainer training conducted at the national capital in Mozambique. Aggregation is separated at various levels to ensure there are no duplications of bills generated for the same registers.", "url": "https://docs.digit.org/health/access/public-health-product-suite/health-campaign-management-hcm/health-payments/payments-user-manual/guide-to-hcm-payments"}

What should I do if bill generation fails? A. Wait for some time and try generating the bill again. Check that all attendance registers have been approved. If the issue persists, contact the system administrator for assistance. 23. Can I edit the Excel sheet of the payment report? A.Payment report sheets are protected and cannot be directly edited. If edits are necessary, duplicate the sheet and make the required changes. Ensure that any modifications are made only with the approval of the respective supervisory authority. 24. How can I change the payment rates for specific roles? A. If certain roles require different payment rates, you need to define those roles separately and assign individuals accordingly. If people in the same role working across different boundaries need different rates, create distinct roles for each boundary. Ensure any changes are made before generating bills 25. Can I assign different payment rates to the same role for different boundaries? A. No, the system currently supports assigning rates based on roles, which must remain consistent across all boundaries. 26.
